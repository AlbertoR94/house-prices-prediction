# House Price Prediction

In this project I will present my solution to the Kaggle competition: [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users] (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course/overview). Even though this competition is intended to be a learning experience rather than a challenge, it allows to apply some of the most important concepts involved in solving machine learning problems. 

First I will explain how I dealt with missing values emphasizing the importance of exploratory analysis in this process, then I will give a detailed explanation of how categorical features were numerically encoded. Finally, the process of training the model is explained. Using this methodology I was able to reach the position 479 in a leaderboard consisting of about 60000 competitors. Considering the fact that no complex feature engineering was performed this is a considerable achievement. Thus the main goal of this project was not the modelling part but the preprocessing stage.
